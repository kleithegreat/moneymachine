# The program's convergence ledger

Written 2026-11-11 21:40 UTC (16:40 EST) by Claude Fable 5.2, session "architect: revision 4, finish". `CLAUDE.md`'s Reviews section asks that each round of adversarial review end with a ledger: the points now agreed, and the disputes still open, each either settled by a derivation both sides accept or reduced to an assumption only the human can choose. This is the ledger after round four. Each later round appends a dated section; nothing above it is edited.

**Read for it:** `architecture.md` revision 4 with its section 9; the verdict tables of revisions 2 and 3 (`git show 35cf871`, section 10; `git show 337619f`, section 8); `audit/decisions.md` from 2026-11-11 20:41 UTC (15:41 EST). **Not reread:** the four reviews themselves. A reviewer's position is taken from the architect's own verdict tables, so where this ledger says a reviewer holds something, that is the architect's reading of the review.

## In plain words

- **What changed in round four.** The wall was overstated by about two and is now three numbers at matched power. A frozen rule with a forward Sharpe near 2 became confirmable in two years, which gives the replication its place as study 2. Study 1's measure became a majority over fresh twin pairs.
- **What is agreed.** That the calendar and the gate's loss cap are separate causes; what an exact test costs; that study 1 is a paired test whose size holds whatever the arms' dependence; that a non-rejection is never absence; that no event-contract venue is certified.
- **What is disputed.** Eight points, D1 to D8. Seven cannot change what is built or run. One can: whether a reading agent makes 33 independent bets a week. It is reduced to a measurement the human has already ordered.
- **Is the program converged?** No, for one reason: no reviewer has seen revision 4. Its two new designs, study 1's measure and study 2, are unreviewed. The round that is owed is the review `CLAUDE.md` already requires before study 1's criterion is committed, so it costs no extra round.

## Who has seen what

| Round | Reviewer | Reviewed | Record |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GPT | Revision 1 | `audit/reviews/2026-11-10-gpt-rearchitecture.md` |
| 1 | Argon | The paper's mathematics | `audit/reviews/2026-11-10-argon-web-paper-math.md` |
| 2 | Argon | Revision 2 | `audit/reviews/2026-11-11-argon-web-rearchitecture-r2.md` |
| 3 | Argon | Revision 3 | `audit/reviews/2026-11-11-argon-web-rearchitecture-r3.md` |
| 4 | none yet | Revision 4 | owed |

GPT has seen nothing since revision 1. So "agreed" below means one of two things, and each row says which: the architect accepted a reviewer's finding and no reviewer has since objected to the answer (**conceded**), or a reviewer examined a claim and let it stand (**examined**).

## Agreed

| | Point | How it was agreed | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | The wall has two causes, the calendar and the gate's loss cap, and each has its own number | Conceded to GPT (finding 6) and to Argon (paper finding 1; round 2, finding 7; round 3, finding 2) | Architecture 2.2, 2.3 |
| A2 | Thresholds are compared at matched power, 80% | Conceded to Argon, round 2, finding 7 | 2.3 |
| A3 | An exact test that stops at its threshold needs `8.59 / e²` bets. Argon wrote 8.67; the difference is 1% and changes no figure | Conceded to Argon, round 3, finding 2 | 2.2 |
| A4 | The cap `1/L` is a choice of the test. A loss bound must be a property of the tested rule | Conceded to Argon, round 3, finding 2 | 2.2 |
| A5 | A Student test on a weekly marked portfolio is not valid under a common shock. An edge claim is judged by the cash of one self-financing account | Conceded to GPT, finding 1 | Section 6 |
| A6 | There is no valid mirror test, and a non-rejection is "not confirmed", never absence | Conceded to GPT, finding 8, and to Argon, round 2, finding 1 | 5.4, section 6 |
| A7 | Study 1 runs the baseline on every market and tests discordant markets. No baseline rate is certified | Conceded to GPT, finding 5 | 5.1 |
| A8 | Study 1's size holds under every joint law of the arms. Its power depends on the overlap and on G100's rate, and every row is shown | Examined by Argon, rounds 2 and 3 (size); conceded (power) | 5.2, 5.3 |
| A9 | Discovery must be the thing the claim names, the plant's effect on the pick's score, and not an alignment of holdings or a mean on a shared sample | Conceded to GPT, finding 3, and to Argon, round 2, finding 6, and round 3, finding 1 | 5.1 |
| A10 | Twins are not additive: the plant feeds N2's variance path | Conceded to Argon, round 3, finding 1; confirmed by the advisor from the code | 5.1 |
| A11 | A session that fails before any evaluation is not an observation of the agent | Conceded to Argon, round 3, finding 5 | 5.2 |
| A12 | At 4 to 9 theses a week a reading agent's forward study has no honest power | Argon's own figure in round 2, finding 3 (499 weeks at 8 bets a week), which the architect reproduced. Round 3 disputes the count, not the arithmetic (D1) | Section 4 |
| A13 | Thirteen of Argon's fourteen paper findings hold in substance, finding 11 among them at a hedged book's funding share | Conceded, the last in round 3 | `argon-paper-findings.md` |
| A14 | Forward means an outcome unknown when the rule is frozen: a forward test reads only what follows its freeze | Conceded to GPT, finding 11 | Section 6 |

## Disputed

Each row gives both positions, then what settles it. "Changes" says whether the dispute could change what is built or run.

| | Dispute | Settled by | Changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | **The count.** Argon: a reading agent makes 45 independent pairs a week, so a forward study is powered. The architect: no count is measured; the threshold is 33 a week at a net edge of 0.05 | **A measurement.** The thesis track's ledger holds registered theses. The advisor counts them a week and estimates their dependence (the human, 2026-11-11 21:26 UTC (16:26 EST)). At 33 or more the reading-agent line reopens as a new design; below it the dispute is over | **Yes,** what is run |
| D2 | **Late records.** Argon (round 3, finding 4): delays that depend on outcomes break the account's 5% bound. The architect: they do not | **A derivation,** awaiting Argon's acceptance or a failing path. `V`, cash plus the conditional expected payout of unrecorded positions, is a non-negative supermartingale on the world's filtration, to which the recorder's delays are adapted (section 6). Argon's example is a Doob martingale throughout | No: no study uses the account |
| D3 | **The paired reading design.** Argon: pairing an agent with filings against one without gives Q2 power. The architect: it is fair and buys no power | **A derivation.** Where the arms agree the difference is zero, so only discordant forecasts count: 859 at five points of hit rate, 3,437 at two and a half (section 4) | No |
| D4 | **The locked suite's confidence level.** Argon: the Bonferroni level is applied in the wrong direction. The architect: it is not | **A derivation.** A higher confidence widens the upper bound, so each cell is harder to pass. What does hold is that the suite certifies the tolerance: a true 0.056 passes 72% of the time (`argon_paper`, item 10) | No: one sentence of the paper, written either way as "certifies the tolerance" |
| D5 | **The deflated Sharpe ratio.** Argon: it fails Sharpe 3.5 over 91 days, and its radicand can be negative. The architect: the first is the wall, the second cannot happen | **A derivation.** Against a threshold of 2, `z ≤ 0.75` on any test. A sample's kurtosis is at least its skewness squared plus one, so the radicand is at least `(1 − skewness·S/2)²` | No: parked machinery |
| D6 | **Stage 4's count.** Argon: the pooled bound should use 13. The architect: v2's "two counted campaigns" are the two with no evaluation | **A fact in the record,** `audit/stage4/`. Either way the pooled bound is withdrawn, which both sides want | No |
| D7 | **The `funding × leak` example.** Argon: a program can earn the twin difference through funding. The architect: funding is drawn before the plant and is identical between twins | **A fact in the code,** now a test: `briefs/1-positive-control.md`, step 1, behaviour 4 | No, unless that test fails; then it is a wall |
| D8 | **The row at rates 0.25 and 0.2.** Argon: the claim's chance is 0.321. The architect: 0.083 | **A computation,** exact enumeration (`sign_test`). The study claims no power there on either figure | No |

Three of Argon's points are moot and stay recorded: "no API can license page text" (no study uses a search API), the depth of a $2,500 purchase (no event-contract study), and the mirror's arithmetic (no mirror).

## Assumptions only the human can choose

| | Assumption | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | "Honest power" means 80% within two years | Used throughout; never put to the human as a choice. A year, or 50%, moves every threshold: at one year the frozen rule needs Sharpe 2.93 |
| H2 | A skilled forecaster keeps a net effect of at most 0.05 a bet on a priced outcome | A prior, not a derivation (architecture 2.4). With D1 it decides whether the reading-agent line ever reopens |
| H3 | Study 2 runs although its power is 0.47 at the vault's recent Sharpe | Chosen: the human, 2026-11-11 21:26 UTC (16:26 EST) |
| H4 | Study 1 ends at 100 markets, G100's target is 0.15, and the claim reads "more often than G100's 100 evaluations" | Chosen: the same decision |
| H5 | The project is academic and stage 11 is gone | Chosen: the human, 2026-11-11 20:41 UTC (15:41 EST) |

## Not yet reviewed

Round three's findings changed the design, so a round is owed, on another model (`CLAUDE.md`, Reviews). No reviewer has seen:

1. **Study 1's measure** (architecture 5.1): the majority over fresh pairs, the bound of 0.0035, and the four model-free walls.
2. **Study 1's band and void rule** (5.2, 5.3).
3. **Study 2** entire (section 6): the hedge, isolated margin as the loss bound, the registered fraction, the walls.
4. **The forward law** `bets a week × e² ≥ 0.083` and the three settlement timings (section 4).
5. **The figure 2.07** and the registered-fraction power rows (2.2). Argon proposed the direction; the numbers are the architect's.

**Where a reviewer should attack first.** Study 1's measure has changed in every round: exact capture, then alignment, then a mean effect with a calibrated `K`, now a majority. Three replacements in three rounds is the pattern `CLAUDE.md` calls patching. The architect's case that this one is a re-derivation: the first three were estimates of a quantity, each broken by how it was estimated; the fourth is a stated property with an exact bound, and walls 2 and 3 test it on known programs before any session. If the round breaks it again, the measure is not the problem and the claim is: the question "does the pick earn from the plant" should then be replaced, not the measure patched.

**The cheapest way to hold the round.** Study 1's criterion must be reviewed before it is committed (`briefs/1-positive-control.md`, step 0). Give that review items 1 and 2. Items 3 to 5 go to the review of the kernel version 2 and study 2 design. GPT has seen nothing since revision 1 and is the other model; if it is unavailable, a fresh Opus session reviews, labeled, with GPT queued.

## Convergence

**Not converged.** The test is that no open dispute would change what is built or run.
- D2 to D8 pass it.
- D1 fails it, and is reduced to a measurement already ordered.
- The five unreviewed items are not disputes, and until a round returns no finding on them that changes the build, nothing can be said either way.

Steps 1 to 6 of study 1's plan are model-free tooling and reversible, so they may be built while the round runs. The criterion's commit, G100's run on study markets and the first session wait for it.
